	  NXP PFE Ethernet controller supports two working modes
	  Standalone and Slave driver mode.

	  Standalone driver for the NXP PFE Ethernet controller.

	  PFE hardware is fully managed by this driver.

	  Slave driver for the NXP PFE Ethernet controller.

	  The Slave driver gets registered but defers its work until
	  it detects Master driver up and running.

	  NOTE: If declared netdevs use different HIF channels,
	  the first one parsed will be used.
